# Speller

Be sure to read this specification in its entirety before starting so you know what to do and how to do it!

Implement a program that spell-checks a file, a la the below, using a hash table.

```
$ ./speller texts/lalaland.txt
MISSPELLED WORDS

WORDS MISSPELLED:
WORDS IN DICTIONARY:
WORDS IN TEXT:
TIME IN load:
TIME IN check:
TIME IN size:
TIME IN unload:
TIME IN TOTAL:

## Understanding

Theoretically, on input of size n, an algorithm with a running time of n is “asymptotically equivalent,” in terms of O, to an algorithm with a running time of 2n. Indeed, when describing the running time of an algorithm, we typically focus on the dominant (i.e., most impactful) term (i.e., n in this case, since n could be much larger than 2). In the real world, though, the fact of the matter is that 2n feels twice as slow as n.

The challenge ahead of you is to implement the fastest spell checker you can! By “fastest,” though, we’re talking actual “wall-clock,” not asymptotic, time.

In speller.c, we’ve put together a program that’s designed to spell-check a file after loading a dictionary of words from disk into memory. That dictionary, meanwhile, is implemented in a file called dictionary.c. (It could just be implemented in speller.c, but as programs get more complex, it’s often convenient to break them into multiple files.) The prototypes for the functions therein, meanwhile, are defined not in dictionary.c itself but in dictionary.h instead. That way, both speller.c and dictionary.c can #include the file. Unfortunately, we didn’t quite get around to implementing the loading part. Or the checking part. Both (and a bit more) we leave to you!

## Specification

Alright, the challenge now before you is to implement, in order, load, hash, size, check, and unload as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that TIME IN load, TIME IN check, TIME IN size, and TIME IN unload are all minimized. To be sure, it’s not obvious what it even means to be minimized, inasmuch as these benchmarks will certainly vary as you feed speller different values for dictionary and for text. But therein lies the challenge, if not the fun, of this problem. This problem is your chance to design. Although we invite you to minimize space, your ultimate enemy is time. But before you dive in, some specifications from us.

You may not alter speller.c or Makefile.
You may alter dictionary.c (and, in fact, must in order to complete the implementations of load, hash, size, check, and unload), but you may not alter the declarations (i.e., prototypes) of load, hash, size, check, or unload. You may, though, add new functions and (local or global) variables to dictionary.c.
You may change the value of N in dictionary.c, so that your hash table can have more buckets.
You may alter dictionary.h, but you may not alter the declarations of load, hash, size, check, or unload.
Your implementation of check must be case-insensitive. In other words, if foo is in dictionary, then check should return true given any capitalization thereof; none of foo, foO, fOo, fOO, fOO, Foo, FoO, FOo, and FOO should be considered misspelled.
Capitalization aside, your implementation of check should only return true for words actually in dictionary. Beware hard-coding common words (e.g., the), lest we pass your implementation a dictionary without those same words. Moreover, the only possessives allowed are those actually in dictionary. In other words, even if foo is in dictionary, check should return false given foo's if foo's is not also in dictionary.
You may assume that any dictionary passed to your program will be structured exactly like ours, alphabetically sorted from top to bottom with one word per line, each of which ends with \n. You may also assume that dictionary will contain at least one word, that no word will be longer than LENGTH (a constant defined in dictionary.h) characters, that no word will appear more than once, that each word will contain only lowercase alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes, and that no word will start with an apostrophe.
You may assume that check will only be passed words that contain (uppercase or lowercase) alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes.
Your spell checker may only take text and, optionally, dictionary as input. Although you might be inclined (particularly if among those more comfortable) to “pre-process” our default dictionary in order to derive an “ideal hash function” for it, you may not save the output of any such pre-processing to disk in order to load it back into memory on subsequent runs of your spell checker in order to gain an advantage.
Your spell checker must not leak any memory. Be sure to check for leaks with valgrind.
You may search for (good) hash functions online, so long as you cite the origin of any hash function you integrate into your own code.
Alright, ready to go?

* Implement load.
* Implement hash.
* Implement size.
* Implement check.
* Implement unload.

## Testing

How to check whether your program is outting the right misspelled words? Well, you’re welcome to consult the “answer keys” that are inside of the keys directory that’s inside of your speller directory. For instance, inside of keys/lalaland.txt are all of the words that your program should think are misspelled.

You could therefore run your program on some text in one window, as with the below.

```
$ ./speller texts/lalaland.txt
```
